## 🔍 **Key Findings**  

### 1️⃣ **What factors determined passenger survival?**  

#### 🟢 **Gender**  
![Survival by Gender](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JMCoC/ml_engineer_roadmap/refs/heads/main/projects/6.%20TitanicEda/reports/genderpercent.png)  
- **74% of women survived**, compared to **19% of men**.

![Survival by Social Class](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JMCoC/ml_engineer_roadmap/refs/heads/main/projects/6.%20TitanicEda/reports/socialclass.png)  
- Higher social status increased survival chances, likely due to **evacuation priority**.  

### 2️⃣ **How did social class and gender affect survival chances?**
