## Objective
Explore the factors that influenced passagener survival

## Key Findings 🔍

## **Main Findings**

### 1. What factors determined which passenger could survive?  
   - **Gender:**: (projects/6. TitanicEda/reports/genderpercent.png)
   - **Explication**: 74% of women survived, compared to 19% of men. This reflects the 'Women and children first' policy.  

   - **Social class**: (projects/6. TitanicEda/reports/socialclass.png).  
   - **Explication**: We can see that higher status could represent a better chance of survival, perhaps influenced by evacuation priority. 

### 2. How did social class and gender affect chances of survival?  
   (projects/6. TitanicEda/reports/classandgernder.png).
   As we see, being a woman in first class represents a survival probability of 97%, while being a man in third class only 14%.
