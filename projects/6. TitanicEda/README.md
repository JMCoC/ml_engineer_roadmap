## 🔍 **Key Findings**  

### 1️⃣ **What factors determined passenger survival?**  

#### 🟢 **Gender**  
![Survival by Gender](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JMCoC/ml_engineer_roadmap/refs/heads/main/projects/6.%20TitanicEda/reports/genderpercent.png)  
- **74% of women survived**, compared to **19% of men**.  
- This reflects the "Women and children first" policy.  

#### 🟢 **Social Class**  
![Survival by Social Class](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JMCoC/ml_engineer_roadmap/refs/heads/main/projects/6.%20TitanicEda/reports/socialclass.png)  
- Higher social status increased survival chances, likely due to **evacuation priority**.

#### 🟢 **Age**
![Survival by Social Class](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JMCoC/ml_engineer_roadmap/refs/heads/main/projects/6.%20TitanicEda/reports/agerange.png)  
- Children under 10 years old had a survival rate of **59%**.

### 2️⃣ **How did social class and gender affect survival chances?**  
![Survival by Class and Gender](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JMCoC/ml_engineer_roadmap/refs/heads/main/projects/6.%20TitanicEda/reports/classandgernder.png)  
- **Women in first class** had a **97% survival rate**, while **men in third class** only had **14%**.  

### 3️⃣ **Conclusion**
- Survival on the Titanic was strongly linked to **social inequalities:** gender, class and age. Although the priority was to **save women and children**, lower-class passengers faced structural barriers to access the boats.
